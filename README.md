# Decorator Design Pattern

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach
new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside
special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

The Decorator pattern extends (decorates) an object’s behavior dynamically. The ability to add new behavior at runtime is accomplished by a Decorator object which ‘wraps itself’ around the original object. Multiple decorators can add or override functionality to the original object.
