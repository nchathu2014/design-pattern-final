# Software Design Principles - SOLID

S - Single Responsibility Principle
A Class Should have just one reason to change

Try to make every class responsible for a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and make that responsibility entirely encapsulated by (you can also say hidden within) the class.

The main goal of this principle is reducing complexity. You
don’t need to invent a sophisticated design for a program that
only has about 200 lines of code. Make a dozen methods pretty,
and you’ll be fine.
