# Mixin Design Pattern

Add functionality to objects or classes without inheritance.

A mixin is an object that we can use in order to add reusable functionality to
another object or class, without using inheritance. We can't use mixins on their
own: their sole purpose is to add functionality to objects or classes without
inheritance.
