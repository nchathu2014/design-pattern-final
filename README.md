# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern (CoR, Chain of Command)

Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets
you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a
request, each handler decides either to process the request or
to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides a chain of loosely coupled objects one of which can satisfy a request. This pattern is essentially a linear search for an object that can handle a particular request.
